# kthlatex
This is a collection LaTeX classes and templates that implement the graphic profile used at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden

These are the templates that are already implemented:
* Masters theses (`kththesis`)
* letters (`kthletter`)
* reports (`kthreport`)
* presentations (`kthpresentation`)
* logos (`kthsymbols`)

These are the templates we intend to implement in the future:
* PhD theses (`kththesis`)
* course material (`kthcourse`: exams, exercises)
