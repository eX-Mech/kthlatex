# kththesis
The goal is to define a kththesis.cls file and a number of templates for Masters and PhD theses in Swedish and English. Currently there are a number of styles available:
* Serafim Dahl's kth-mag.sty: http://www.nada.kth.se/~serafim/xjobb/
* Lars Engebretsen's kthesis: http://system.csc.kth.se/misc/tex/
* Örjan Ekeberg's kththesis: http://www.csc.kth.se/~ekeberg/latex/

Örjan's should be the closest to the current graphic profile. We should make sure that the style file supports both Master's and PhD theses.
