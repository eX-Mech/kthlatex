# kththesis
The goal is to define a kththesis.cls file and a number of templates for Masters and PhD theses in Swedish and English. The current class is based on Ã–rjan Ekeberg's kththesis also found here: http://www.csc.kth.se/~ekeberg/latex/

Earlier styles for reference are:
* Serafim Dahl's kth-mag.sty: http://www.nada.kth.se/~serafim/xjobb/
* Lars Engebretsen's kthesis: http://system.csc.kth.se/misc/tex/
